# Helm StatefulSet

## Steps result

1. Output of `kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc`

```

1. Access the service several times from different browsers and/or incognito mode

1. Get data from each pod.

   > My helm charm implements a liveness probe, therefore, the root endpoint is accessed frequently.
   > I retrieve the visits log using a simple bash script to be fast enough to show that the data is different due to different volumes
   > instead of my slowness

   ```bash
   ❯ for i in {0..2}
     do
         echo "Pod №${i} data:"
         kubectl exec pod/app-python-app-python-chart-${i} -- tail -n 5 /home/moscow_clock/media/visits.txt
     done

   ```

1. Describe and explain in the report the differences between the output
   of the command for replicas:

   > Using a `deployment` resulted in a single PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for all pods.
   > Consequently, all instances were writing to/reading from the same file.
   > Such race condition leads to performance degradation.
   > The Stateful state utilizes `volumeClaimTemplates` - a template for PVC for each pod,
   > making all instances operating over different files.

1. For our app ordering guarantee are unnecessary. Describe in the report why:

   > Ordering may be required for setting up a cluster,
   > when one may need to start-up a master node first, then connect workers.
   > Our app instances are independent of each other, thus ordering only slows the start up.

1. Then find a way to tell to the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel.

   > StatefulSet has 2 pod management policies:
   >
   > - `OrderedReady` - operate a new pods only after the previous is ready
   > - `Parallel` - controls all pods in parallel
   >
   > `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"` is our way to go

   ```bash
   ❯ helm secrets install app-python ./app-python-chart -f ./app-python-chart/secrets.yaml > /dev/null

   ❯ kubectl get po
    NAME                            READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE

    app-python-app-python-chart-2   1/1     Terminating   0          40m

   ❯ kubectl get po
